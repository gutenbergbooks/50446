INTRODUCTION


It is a generation since a dictionary of explosives has been
published, and, in the meantime, many new explosives have been
introduced. It is hoped, therefore, that this small volume, giving
concise information about these special materials, may prove useful
to those who have to deal with them. In Cundill and Thomson’s
“Dictionary of Explosives,” issued in 1895, there are many entries of
the names of inventors and of mixtures which had been proposed but
have never been used commercially, nor are likely to be. As modern
explosives were then in their infancy, it was no doubt wise to insert
all the available information whether it appeared to be important
or not; but now it seems to me better to restrict the scope of the
dictionary so as to keep its size within moderate limits. Practically
only explosives with special or proprietary names are therefore dealt
with here. For information concerning chemical substances, such as
the nitro-toluenes and other nitro-compounds, reference should be
made to the textbooks on explosives and chemistry.

A few words may, however, be said here about the nitrocelluloses.
These are made by treating cellulose with a mixture of nitric
and sulphuric acids, and then purifying the product by washing
it thoroughly with hot water. The variety of cellulose most used
for this purpose is cotton, and the product obtained from it is
frequently called nitrocotton, three special varieties of which are
collodion cotton, pyrocollodion and guncotton (_q. v._). The only
other form of cellulose which is nitrated on a commercial scale is
“chemical cellulose” obtained by the treatment of wood or straw.
Nitrated wood cellulose has long been used for the manufacture of
smokeless powders for shot-guns, and during the War the Germans made
powders for rifled fire-arms from it.

No trouble has been spared to make the dictionary complete and
accurate, but there must inevitably be omissions and errors in it,
especially as regards the explosives of foreign countries. The author
will be grateful for any additional information that may be sent him.

Explosives may be classified in various ways, according to the
purpose of the classification, but the great majority of them fall
naturally into two main divisions: propellants and high explosives.
Propellants explode comparatively slowly, and are used to propel
projectiles from fire-arms. High explosives are much more rapid in
their action, and are used for bursting and shattering. Propellants
are of two sorts, according as they are intended for use in shot-guns
or rifled fire-arms. Those for shot-guns burn more rapidly than those
for the latter, but both practically always contain a considerable
proportion of nitrocellulose, gelatinised by means of such solvents
as acetone or ether-alcohol, according as it is of high or low
nitration. Some contain also nitroglycerine, and are then called
nitroglycerine powders, whereas those that do not contain this
substance are termed nitrocellulose powders. Many powders also
contain other ingredients, as may be seen from the compositions given
in this dictionary.

Of high explosives an important class is used for charging shells
and bombs. As a rule, but not necessarily, these are not the same
as the explosives used for mining operations and other general
blasting purposes. Another important class is that of the coal-mine
explosives, which are designed to give only a short and comparatively
cool flame so as to diminish the danger of igniting fire-damp
and coal-dust. Nearly half the explosives in this dictionary are
coal-mine explosives. The reason for this large number is that no
finality has yet been reached as to the best and safest explosives
to use in coal mines. When more experience has been gained it is
probable that the number of these explosives on the market will
be reduced. In England the Permitted List has recently been cut down
considerably.

In Great Britain these coal-mine explosives have to be submitted
to the Inspectors of Explosives, and are subjected to tests for
safety and strength. If they pass they are placed on the list of
“Permitted Explosives,” and the compositions are published in the
Explosives in Coal Mines Orders. In these Orders the upper and lower
limits of the percentage of each constituent are given, but in this
dictionary intermediate percentages are given so that the sum for any
explosive amounts to 100. In the Explosives in Coal Mines Orders the
percentage of such a substance as wood, meal or starch, is given in
the dried condition, but here it is given in the air-dry state on the
assumption that it then contains about 10 per cent. of moisture.

In France and Belgium also the compositions of the coal-mine
explosives are published, but in Germany, as a rule, only a list of
the constituents is given, and sometimes an upper or lower limit for
one or more of the principal constituents. Moreover, it is not stated
explicitly whether the explosives are intended for use in coal mines
or for general blasting purposes. In the United States of America,
explosives intended for use in coal mines are examined by the Bureau
of Mines, which, however, has no power to prevent the use of others
because regulations on this matter are made by the individual states.
If they pass they are placed on the list of “Permissible Explosives.”
The compositions are not published, but the class of composition is
stated.

Until the second half of the nineteenth century, gunpowder was
practically the only explosive used on a considerable scale, and it
was employed for all purposes. Consequently it does not fall into any
of the classes mentioned, or rather it could be placed in several of
them.

Another class of explosives that has not yet been mentioned is that
of the primary igniters, of which fulminate of mercury may be taken
as typical. The characteristic of these is that they can be exploded
or ignited by a spark or moderate friction, and consequently they
can be employed to fire other, less sensitive explosives. There
are, however, practically no explosives of this class which possess
special or proprietary names, and consequently they are not dealt
with in this dictionary.

been replaced by trinitro-toluene. It is used for filling grenades
and general blasting purposes, but is not permitted in dangerous coal
mines.

=AEROLIT= is a Danish ammonium nitrate explosive, _e.g._--

  Ammonium nitrate      78·125
  Potassium nitrate      7·5
  Sulphur                8·75

  Resin                  0·625

=AETNA COAL POWDER= is an American coal-mine powder on the
Permissible List. Brands A, B and C are nitroglycerine explosives.
AA and No. 2 are ammonium nitrate explosives.

=AETNA POWDER.=--A variety of American dynamite containing 15
to 65 per cent. of nitroglycerine mixed with wood pulp and sodium
nitrate. Roasted flour has sometimes been substituted for wood pulp.

=AJAX POWDER.=--A coal-mine explosive made by
Nobel’s Explosives Co.

    _Date of Permit_                    1-9-13
  Nitroglycerine                          22·3
  Nitrocotton                              0·7
  Di- and trinitro-toluenes                3·5
  Potassium perchlorate                   37
  Wood meal                               11·5
  Ammonium oxalate                        25
  Limit charge                            12 oz.
  Power (swing of ballistic pendulum)      2·69”

In 1914, 329,000 lbs. were used in coal mines, but the permit
has now been repealed.

=ALBIONITE.=--A mixture of gelignite and ammonium
oxalate. It was formerly on the Permitted List.

=ALBIT.=--A German chlorate explosive introduced in 1915 in
consequence of the scarcity of nitrates due to the War. It is defined
as consisting of not more than 80 per cent. sodium or potassium
chlorate, not more than 4 per cent. nitroglycerine, and mono- or
dinitro-hydrocarbons. It may also contain inorganic salts and carbon
carriers such as vegetable meal, oils, soaps or carbohydrates.
A variety made for use in coal mines is called Wetter-Albit or
Kohlen-Albit.

=ALDORFIT.= See =DORFIT=.

=ALKALSIT.=--A German chlorate or perchlorate explosive made by
the Dynamit A.-G. of Hamburg. It contains not more than 80 per cent.
sodium or potassium chlorate, or not more than 80 per cent. sodium,
potassium or ammonium perchlorate, and 19 per cent. of aromatic
nitro-hydrocarbons and nitrocotton, also coal, hydrocarbons or
carbohydrates, and nitrates. The chlorate mixtures must not contain
ammonium salts. Alkalsit I contains not more than 27 per cent. of
potassium perchlorate, ammonium nitrate, not more than 24 per cent.
of sodium nitrate, not more than 8 per cent. of trinitro-toluene,
also wood meal, flour and nitro-naphthalene. Alkalsit A contains not
more than 55 per cent. of potassium perchlorate, ammonium nitrate,
not more than 31 per cent. trinitro-toluene, and not more than 5 per
cent. of a neutral liquid mixture of nitrated toluenes. Alkalsit B is
similar except that it contains also ammonium nitrate.

=ALSILITE S.G.P.=--A Belgian coal-mine explosive on the list of

It was made by the Société Anonyme de Vilvorde in Belgium, and was
originally called Ugolite.

Rock Amasite and S.T. Amasite are non-permitted explosives of
composition somewhat similar to the above.

=AMATOL.=--A mixture of ammonium nitrate and trinitro-toluene.
The composition is shown by the figures placed after the name;
thus Amatol 40/60 contains 40 per cent. ammonium nitrate and 60

ammonium nitrate and 20 parts trinitro-toluene. These explosives are
used very extensively for filling shell and other projectiles. The
mixtures rich in trinitro-toluene can be cast after being heated to
temperature above the melting-point of this constituent, but those
rich in ammonium nitrate are stemmed into the projectile hot or
pressed. Similar mixtures are used by the Germans and other powers
under various names. In Germany it is called Füllpulver (q. v.).

=AMATOXOL.=--A mixture of ammonium nitrate and Toxol, which
consists of trinitro-toluene and trinitro-xylene.

*=AMBERITE.=--A smokeless shot-gun powder made by Curtis’s and
Harvey at Tonbridge. Amberite No. 1 contained nitroglycerine as well
as nitrocotton and various other substances. According to “Arms
and Explosives,” 1917, p. 78, a sample of Amberite No. 2 had the
composition--

  Insoluble nitrocotton                 18·6
  Soluble        ”                      46·0
  Nitrates of potassium and barium      28·0
  Vaseline                               6·0
  Volatile matter                        1·4

This is still on the market. It is a fibrous 42-grain bulk
powder.

*=AMIDE POWDER= or Chilworth Special Powder was an early attempt
at a smokeless powder. Under the name of Amidpulver it was used by
the German artillery for some years in the ’eighties of the last
century. Its composition was--

  Ammonium nitrate      35-38
  Potassium nitrate     40-46
  Charcoal              14-22

See also Ammonpulver and Hebler Powder.

=AMMONAL= is a blasting explosive containing ammonium nitrate,
aluminium powder, charcoal, and generally trinitro-toluene. It was
patented in 1900 by G. Roth of Vienna, and the following are some of
the compositions made by his firm at Felixdorf in Austria--

                         _a_    _b_   _c_   _d_
  Ammonium nitrate      80·75    90    88    80
  Aluminium             15        4     8    18
  Charcoal               4·25     6     4     2

More violent mixtures made by the same firm are--

                         I   II
  Ammonium nitrate      46   32
  Trinitro-toluene      30   50
  Aluminium             22   16
  Charcoal               2    2

and modifications of this have been used largely in the British
service. It is not suitable for use in underground workings as it
forms on explosion the poisonous gas carbon monoxide, unless the
proportion of ammonium nitrate be large. It has been used for
charging grenades, and by the Austrians for trench howitzer bombs.

When the explosive is detonated, the aluminium is converted into the
oxide, evolving no gas, but a considerable amount of heat, which
increases the power of the explosive. The aluminium powder also
renders the explosive easier to detonate.

Three explosives of this type passed the Woolwich Test, and were on
the old Permitted List for coal mines, namely, Ammonal B, Ripping
Ammonal and Saint Helen’s Powder (q. v.).

                                        Ripping
                          Ammonal B.    Ammonal.
  Ammonium nitrate          94·5          86
  Aluminium                  3             8
  Charcoal                   2·5           2·5
  Potassium bichromate       --            3·5

No explosives containing aluminium are on the present Permitted List.

=AMMONCAHUECIT=}       =CAHUECIT=.
               }  See
=AMMONCARBONIT=}       =CARBONIT=.

=AMMONIAKKRUT= was the first ammonium nitrate explosive. It
was invented by J. Ohlsson and J. H. Norrbin, two Swedes, and was
protected by English Patent 2766 of 1869. It consisted of ammonium
nitrate together with 5 or 10 per cent. of charcoal, coal dust, etc.,
to which mixture was added 10 to 30 per cent. of nitroglycerine to
make it less difficult to detonate.

=AMMONITE= is a coal-mine explosive of the Favier type, made by
the Miners’ Safety Explosives Co. The original composition, which
passed the Woolwich Test was--

  Ammonium nitrate       88
  Dinitro-naphthalene    12

To pass the more severe Rotherham Test a number of compositions have
been made and approved, but some of them have been repealed. Those
now on the Permitted List are--

                           Ammonite  Ammonite.  Ammonite
                            No. 1.               No. 5.

    ballistic pendulum)      2·42      2·44       2·41”

Ammonite No. 1 is used on a considerable scale in coal mines. A
non-permitted explosive called Ripping Ammonite is also made.

*=AMMONPULVER= is a propellant which was used by the Austrians
from 1890 to 1896 in guns of various calibres--

  Ammonium nitrate  80-90
  Charcoal          10-20

It was superseded by a powder of the ballistite type, but has been
reintroduced recently by the Germans to replace a part of the charge
of nitrocellulose powder in their field gun. The advantages claimed
for it are small erosion of the gun, absence of muzzle flame,
chemical stability, and cheapness. On the other hand, it gives high
pressures, and if used by itself requires a gun with a specially
large chamber; but the most serious objection to it is that on
keeping, physical changes take place in the pellets, leading to the
production of very high pressures. It is said that moisture promotes
these changes. See also Amide Powder.

=AMVIS.=--A coal-mine explosive formerly on the Permitted List--

  Potassium nitrate   22
  Wood meal            7

It has now been repealed.

=ASTRALIT.=--An ammonium nitrate explosive containing a little
blasting gelatine, made by the Dynamit A. G. Nobel of Hamburg. It has
been used largely in Germany for a variety of purposes.

Astralit I and II are defined as consisting of ammonium nitrate,
charcoal, vegetable meal, not more than 15 per cent. of aromatic
nitro-bodies not more dangerous than trinitro-toluene, not more than
4 per cent. of blasting gelatine; also paraffin oil.

Astralit IV consists of ammonium nitrate, not more than 10 per cent.
of aromatic nitro-bodies not more dangerous than dinitro-naphthalene,
vegetable meal, and not more than 4 per cent. of blasting gelatine.

Astralit V, which has been introduced recently, contains up to
10 per cent. of potassium perchlorate in addition to ammonium
nitrate, also vegetable meal, not more than 16 per cent. of aromatic
nitro-compounds, and not more than 4 per cent. of nitroglycerine.

Gelatine-Astralit is a gelatinised or powdery mixture of the nitrates
of ammonium and sodium (or potassium), not more than 50 per cent. of
dinitro-chlorhydrin, not more than 5 per cent. of nitroglycerine, not
more than 2 per cent. of collodion cotton, vegetable meal, aromatic

in that part of the ammonium nitrate is replaced by sodium chloride.

Wetter-Gelatine-Astralit is also a coal-mine explosive, and differs
from Gelatine-Astralit in that it contains also fatty oils and
neutral salts, such as potassium chloride, sodium chloride or an
oxalate.

The following percentage compositions have been given--

                 Astralit.  Wetter-

Explosives of the Astralit type have also been used extensively
by the Germans for filling trench howitzer shell and similar
projectiles. The following is approximately the composition used for
this purpose--

  Nitroglycerine     3
  Nitrocotton        0·5
  Ammonium nitrate  77
  Trinitro-toluene  16

This explosive was authorised in England under the name of Australite.

=ATLAS POWDER.=--A brand of American straight dynamite.

=AUSTRALITE.= See =ASTRALIT=.

*=AXITE.= A smokeless powder made by Kynoch, Ltd., and used for
sporting rifles. It is a sort of Cordite MD, with a little of the
guncotton replaced by potassium nitrate, and is in the form of flat
strips. A sample had the composition--

  Guncotton          63·1
  Potassium nitrate   1·9
  Mineral jelly       5·1
  Volatile matter     0·2

*=B.=--Poudre B is the French service propellant. It consists
of nitrocotton gelatinised with ether-alcohol, in which it is partly
soluble. A little diphenylamine is added to increase the stability.
Formerly, various other additions have been made. A letter or letters
are added to show the size of the powder and the purpose for which it
is used--

  Poudre BF for rifles (from _f_usil).
         BNF a later powder for rifles (from _n_ouveau).
         BC for field guns (from _c_ampagne).
         BSP for siege howitzers (from _s_iège et _p_lace).
         BGC for larger military guns (from _g_ros _c_alibre).
         BM for naval ordnance (from _m_arine); a figure is
          added to show the size.

Further letters and figures are added to show other particulars about
the powder; D_2 means 2 per cent. of diphenylamine has been added
as a stabiliser, or AM_8, 8 per cent. of amyl alcohol. The place
and date of manufacture are similarly indicated.

=BAELENITE.=--A Belgian mining explosive--

                     I.  II.
  Ammonium nitrate   85  95
  Trinitro-toluene   15   5

  Charge limite       0  75

It is authorised for manufacture in, or importation into the United
Kingdom.

*=BALLISTITE.=--One of the first military smokeless
powders, invented by Nobel. It consisted of about equal parts of
nitroglycerine and soluble nitrocotton incorporated together under
water, then passed repeatedly through rolls and cut into flakes. It
was adopted by a number of Continental powers, but in consequence
of the severe erosion of the guns which it caused, it has been
modified or abandoned. The percentage of nitroglycerine is reduced,
and consequently it is necessary to use a solvent such as acetone. A
little mineral jelly or other stabiliser is sometimes added.

=BARATOL.=--A mixture of barium nitrate and trinitro-toluene.

=BARBARIT.=--A German chlorate explosive made at the
Sprengstoff-fabriken Kriewald bei Gleinitz.

  Potassium chlorate      90-92

nitrated naphthalene, formerly used in coal mines.

=BAUTZENER SICHERHEITSPULVER.=--A German coal-mine explosive
containing not less than 70 per cent. of ammonium nitrate, barium
nitrate, and not more than 15 per cent. of trinitro-toluene.

=BAVARIT.=--A German coal-mine explosive similar to Grisounite.
It contains 90 per cent. of ammonium nitrate together with nitrated
naphthalene; charcoal may be added.

=BELLITE= is essentially a mixture of ammonium nitrate and
metadinitro-benzene. It has been used extensively as a coal-mine
explosive, and was patented by C. Lamm of Stockholm in 1885. Two
varieties passed the Woolwich Test and were on the old Permitted
List--

                    No. 1.  No. 3.
  Ammonium nitrate   83·5    93·5
  Dinitro-benzene    16·5     6·5

No. 1 contains just enough oxygen for complete combustion, and No.
3 contains a large excess of oxygen. To enable the explosive to
pass the Rotherham Test sodium chloride has been added. There were
four varieties on the present Permitted List, but all except the
following, No. 1, have been repealed--

                          No. 1.

=BENTAL COAL POWDER.=--An American coal-mine explosive on the
Permissible List. It is an ammonium nitrate explosive.

=BITUMINITE.=--There are several coal-mine explosives of this
name on the American Permissible List. Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 8 L.F. are
nitroglycerine explosives. No. 5 is an ammonium nitrate explosive.

=BLACK DIAMOND.=--There are several coal-mine explosives of this
name on the American Permissible List. Nos. 2A, 3A and 6 L.F. are
nitroglycerine explosives, whereas Nos. 5, 7 and 8 are ammonium
nitrate explosives.

=BLACK POWDER= is a name for ordinary gunpowder, a mixture of
potassium nitrate, sulphur and charcoal.

=BLASTINE= is a high explosive having approximately the
composition--

  Ammonium perchlorate  60
  Sodium nitrate        23
  Dinitro-toluene       11
  Paraffin wax           6

As the sodium nitrate in the above is not equivalent to the ammonium
perchlorate, part of the chlorine is given off in the form of the
poisonous gas, hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid).

=BLASTING GELATINE.=--Nitroglycerine, stiffened by having
collodion cotton dissolved in it. Discovered by Nobel in 1875. It
contains about--

  Nitroglycerine    93
  Collodion cotton   7

and also often a fraction of a percentage of calcium or magnesium
carbonate to increase its stability. This is the most powerful of all
the explosives in common use.

=BOBBINITE.=--The only explosive of the gunpowder class the
use of which is permitted in coal mines in England. In most foreign
countries explosives of this class are not allowed to be used in them
at all. The permission is only temporary, but has been extended to
the end of 1920, and is restricted to mines that are not gassy or
dangerous from coal dust. There are two definitions, but the second
is the one that is generally manufactured apparently--

                                   First.  Second.
  Potassium nitrate                 63·5     65

  Moisture                           1        1

More than a million pounds of this explosive are used in coal mines
every year. It shatters the coal less than high explosives do.

=BOMLIT.=--A German potassium perchlorate blasting explosive
made by Wolff et Cie. at Walsrode. It contains also ammonium nitrate,
trinitro-toluene and guncotton. Other ingredients that may be present
are potassium and sodium nitrates, starch meal, vaseline, naphthalene
and other hydrocarbons, charcoal and castor oil.

=BRITONITE.=--A coal-mine explosive of the Carbonite type, made
by the British Explosives Syndicate, Ltd., Pitsea. The original
composition passed the Woolwich Test and was on the list of Permitted
Explosives, but on the introduction of the Rotherham Test it became
necessary to add ammonium oxalate or sodium chloride. Nos. 2 and 3
were on the Permitted List, but have now been repealed.

                                    No. 2.   No. 3.

=BROWN POWDER.= See =COCOA POWDER=.

=BRUGÈRE’S POWDER= consisted of--

  Ammonium picrate   54
  Potassium nitrate  46

It was stated to give good results in the Chassepôt rifle, but
picrate mixtures are liable to detonate, and are therefore dangerous
to use as propellants.

=BULL DOG= Gunpowder Pellets were used in coal mines. They
contained the same constituents as Bobbinite, which superseded them,
but in different proportions.

Explosifs =C= were mixtures of ammonium cresylate with ammonium
or sodium nitrate. They were made in France at one time, but their
manufacture was dropped, as they were more expensive to make than
Grisounite, and no more powerful.

=CAHUECIT.=--This was invented in the ’seventies of the last
century by R. Cahuc, and was manufactured at Dartford in Kent under
the name of Safety Blasting Powder or Carboazotine. It is still made
in Germany. The ingredients are--

                       English.  German.
  Potassium nitrate      64        70
  Sulphur flowers        12        12
  Lampblack or soot       7         8
  Bark or wood pulp      17        10

to which are added a few per cent. of sulphate of iron. The
incorporation is carried out with the assistance of a considerable
quantity of water, which is afterwards evaporated off. The mixing is
not very thorough. The explosive is a comparatively mild one, but
is used sometimes for blasting basalt. In the German explosive the
potassium nitrate may be replaced by the corresponding sodium salt.

=AMMONCAHUECIT.=--In this explosive the potassium nitrate is
replaced mainly or wholly by ammonium nitrate, and it contains not
more than 15 per cent. of trinitro-toluene or trinitro-naphthalene or
other nitro-body.

The brand labelled “Fram” contains ammonium nitrate, not more than 25
per cent. of trinitro-toluene gelatinised with 4 per cent. collodion
cotton, wood meal or other vegetable meal and neutral stable salts.
The brand “Indra” is similar, except that it contains also not
more than 10 per cent. potassium nitrate, and the percentage of
trinitro-toluene may be raised to 20.

=CAMBRITE= is a coal-mine explosive of the Carbonite type made
by Nobels at Ardeer. It consists practically of Nobel Carbonite, to
which 8 per cent. of a cooling agent has been added. Unlike most of
the explosives on the old Permitted List, it passed the Rotherham
Test with practically no alteration--

                              Cambrite.   No. 2.
  _Date of Permit_             1-9-13     1-4-15

  Power (swing of ballistic
    pendulum)                    1·98       2·00”

Only No. 2 is now on the Permitted List.

=CAMERON MINE POWDER.=--There are a number of coal-mine explosives
of this name on the American Permissible List. Nos. 1A, 2A and 2A
LF are ammonium nitrate explosives, whereas Nos. 3A and 5A are
nitroglycerine explosives.

=*CANNONITE= was a smokeless powder made by a firm called the
War and Sporting Smokeless Powder Syndicate, Ltd. It consisted
of about 86 per cent. of nitrocellulose mostly insoluble in
ether-alcohol, and a few per cent. of barium nitrate, together
with small quantities of some of the following: potassium nitrate,
charcoal, lampblack, vaseline, rosin, stearine, dinitro-benzene,
trinitro-toluene, potassium ferro-cyanide, graphite. For shot-guns
the powder was of the forty-two grain type, dense and gelatinised.
The rifle powder was colloidal. These powders were made in the
’nineties of the last century.

=CARBITE D’ABLON= is a sort of Carbonite made in France--

  Nitroglycerine        26
  Potassium nitrate     33
  Wood meal or flour    41

=CARBOAZOTINE.= See =CAHUECIT=.

=CARBO-DYNAMITE= was an explosive patented by W. D. Borland.
It differed from ordinary dynamite in that the nitroglycerine was
absorbed in cork charcoal instead of kieselguhr. One part of the
charcoal sufficed to absorb nine parts of nitroglycerine.

=CARBONITE= (or Karbonit) was one of the earliest and one of
the most successful coal-mine explosives. It was first made by
Bichel and Schmidt at Schlebusch in Germany in 1885, and after some
modifications gave satisfactory results at the Neunkirchen testing
station in 1887. It contains about 26 per cent. of nitroglycerine,
33 per cent. of a nitrate, and 40 per cent. of wood meal or starch
flour, and small quantities of other substances. Nobel Carbonite
passed the Woolwich Test and had the composition--

  Nitroglycerine                   26
  Barium nitrate                    4
  Potassium nitrate                29
  Wood meal                        40·5
  “Sulphuretted benzol”             0·25
  Sodium and calcium carbonates     0·25

The Carbonite made at the works of the Carbonite Syndicate at
Schlebusch, and imported into Great Britain, was practically the
same as this, but they also made another explosive which passed
the Woolwich Test, and contained 35 per cent. of nitroglycerine
gelatinised with nitrocotton, and smaller proportions of nitrates
and wood meal than are given above: this was called Extra-Carbonite.
They have also made explosives to numerous modifications of this
formula for use on the Continent. The essential feature of all of
them is that they contain so much of the combustible constituents,
such as wood meal, that most of the carbon appears in the products
of explosion as carbon monoxide, and the temperature of the gases is
consequently low.

Nobels at Ardeer also made a low freezing explosive in
which part of the nitroglycerine was replaced by a nitro-compound.
This was called Arctic Carbonite--

  Nitroglycerine       15·5
  Nitro-hydrocarbon    10·5
  Potassium nitrate    42
  Wood meal            31·7
  Calcium carbonate     0·3

Various manufacturers have made explosives of the type of Carbonite
and placed them on the market under different names, such as Tutol,
Kolax, Kohlen-Carbonite, Minite and Colinite. These, however, do not
pass the Rotherham Test for Permitted Explosives, unless ammonium
oxalate or other cooling agent be added, as in the case of Cambrite,
Super-Kolax and Britonite No. 2.

On the Continent, explosives similar to Arctic Carbonite have been
produced under the names Antigel de Sûreté and Ingélite.

There are several Carbonites on the American Permissible List. Of
these Nos. 1 to 4 are in order of diminishing violence: Nos. 5 and
6 are low freezing varieties. There are also a number of other
explosives of the Carbonite type on the List.

Ammonkarbonit is a German coal-mine explosive, containing about 80
per cent. of ammonium nitrate and 4 per cent. of blasting gelatine,
together with 5 or 10 per cent. of potassium nitrate, and a
combustible such as flour, starch or coal dust. Sodium or potassium
chloride may be added as a cooling agent. It has been used for
blasting clay.

Gelatine-Karbonit is a Carbonite containing ammonium nitrate, and a
considerable proportion of nitroglycerine gelatinised with collodion
cotton.

Halokarbonit is similar to Ammonkarbonit, except that a considerable
proportion of the ammonium nitrate is replaced by other nitrates.

=CARLSONITE= was the first ammonium perchlorate explosive
submitted to H.M. Inspectors of Explosives. It was proposed in 1898
by Carlson of Stockholm, and some of the mixtures were reported on
favourably, but no licence was ever taken out in the United Kingdom
for this explosive.

=C.E.= (Composition Exploding) is the same as Tetryl.

=CELTITE= was a coal-mine explosive made by Dr. R. Nahnsen &
Co., Hamburg, and formerly permitted for use in British coal mines,
having passed the Woolwich Test.

  Nitroglycerine       57
  Nitrocotton           3
  Potassium nitrate    19
  Wood meal             9
  Ammonium oxalate     12

It was also called Zeltit.

=*CENTRALITE= is not an explosive, but is a name given
to a substance which has been used to modify the surface of
smokeless powder, and make it burn progressively. The substance is
dimethyl-diphenyl-urea. (See Brit. Pat. 29,882 of 1909.) It acts also
as a stabiliser.

=CHEDDITE= is a chlorate explosive which has been rendered less
sensitive by having the particles of chlorate coated with castor oil
or paraffin wax. It is manufactured by the French Government at the
Vonges Powder Works, and has also been made in other countries. The
two types that have been most used in France are--

                        O2 or No. 4.    O5 or No. 1.
  Potassium chlorate        79             --
  Sodium chlorate           --             79
  Castor oil                 5              5
  Mononitro-naphthalene      1             --
  Dinitro-toluene           15             16

=*CHEESA STICKS= are sticks of cordite coated with powdered
ammonium oxalate and shellac. They are used in South Africa as
fuses for blasting charges. They are authorised in England only for
manufacture and immediate export.

=*CHILWORTH SMOKELESS POWDER.= See =C.S.P.=

=*CHILWORTH SPECIAL POWDER.= See =AMIDE POWDER=.

=CHLORATIT= is an Austrian explosive, which was permitted for
use in coal mines during the War.

=CHLORATZIT.=--A German explosive containing potassium chlorate or
perchlorate, aromatic nitro-bodies, resins and carbohydrates. For use
in coal mines neutral salts are added as cooling agents, and the name
then has =WETTER= or =KOHLEN= prefixed to it.

=CHROMAMONIT= was a coal-mine explosive formerly made in Germany--

  Ammonium nitrate          63·25
  Potassium nitrate         17·5
  Collodion cotton           9·25
  Chromium ammonium alum     9·5
  Vaseline                   0·5

=*CLERMONITE.=--A Belgian shot-gun powder made by the Cooppal
Co. It is a 40-grain fibrous powder of the bulk type and coloured
green.

=CLIFFITE= was a coal-mine explosive made by Curtis’s and
Harvey, and formerly on the Permitted List--

  Nitroglycerine      47
  Collodion cotton     3
  Starch              50

=SUPER-CLIFFITE= differs considerably from this. There are two
formulæ which have passed the Rotherham Test, but only No. 2 is still
on the Permitted List--

                             No. 1.    No. 2.
  _Date of Permit_           21-9-16   21-9-16

  Power (swing of ballistic
    pendulum)                   2·53      2·53”

=CLYDITE= was a coal-mine explosive formerly made by Nobels at
Ardeer. It was similar to Nobel Carbonite, but the potassium nitrate
was replaced by the barium salt, and it might contain up to 8 per
cent. of ammonium oxalate.

=COALITE.=--There is a series of coal-mine explosives of this
name on the American Permissible List. Varieties X, 3X, and 3XC
are ammonium nitrate explosives; whereas 1, 2D, 2DL and 2MLF are
nitroglycerine explosives.

=COAL SPECIAL= are American coal-mine explosives on the
Permissible List. They are all nitroglycerine explosives.

=COCOA POWDER= or Brown Powder was a variety of gunpowder made
with a brown charcoal prepared from straw--

  Potassium nitrate    79
  Sulphur               3
  Straw charcoal       18

It was compressed to a density of 1·8 into prisms or grains of
considerable size, and was used in guns of large calibre. E.X.E. and
S.B.C. were special varieties of this.

=COLINIT ANTIGRISOUTEUSE.=--A Belgian coal-mine explosive of the
Carbonite type. The ordinary formula is practically the same as that
of Kohlencarbonite and Minerite. Type B consists of--

  Blasting gelatine          26
  Potassium perchlorate       6
  Ammonium nitrate           20
  Trinitro-toluene           12
  Rye flour and cellulose    29
  Magnesium sulphate          7

=COLLIER POWDER.=--There are a number of coal-mine explosives
of this name on the American Permissible List. Varieties BNF, KN,
X, XLF, 5, 5LF, 5 Special, 9, 11, and 11LF are ammonium nitrate
explosives whereas 2 and 6LF are nitroglycerine explosives.

=COLLODION COTTON= is a variety of nitrocotton of low nitration,
almost completely soluble in a mixture of ether and alcohol. It
contains not more than 12·3 per cent. of nitrogen. It also dissolves
in nitroglycerine and liquid nitro-compounds, rendering them
gelatinous and so preventing their exudation.

=*COOPPAL’S POWDER.=--A Belgian smokeless shot-gun powder.
Formerly it was much the same as Schultze Powder, consisting of
nitrolignin carefully purified, and mixed with nitrates with or
without the addition of starch. The following analyses were published
in “Arms and Explosives” for July 1917--

                               No. 1.     No. 2.
                               1892.      1900.

=CORDITE= is the principal smokeless powder of the British
Services. It was originally adopted in 1888, and is made by mixing
nitroglycerine with guncotton and mineral jelly (a sort of crude
vaseline), and incorporating them together with the aid of acetone,
which gelatinises the guncotton. In consequence of the severe erosion
of the guns experienced during the South African War the proportions
were altered, some of the nitroglycerine being replaced by guncotton.
The propellant thus “modified” is called Cordite M.D., whereas that
of the original composition is Cordite Mk.I. Both are still in use,
especially M.D.--

                    Mk. I.   M.D.

  Guncotton           37      65
  Nitroglycerine      58      30
  Mineral jelly        5       5

During the great European War a further variety was introduced to
extend the basis of supply of solvents. This is called Cordite R.D.B.
(Research Department B), and contains a nitrocotton of comparatively
low nitration that can be gelatinised by means of a mixture of ether
and alcohol--

  Nitrocotton       52
  Nitroglycerine    42
  Mineral jelly      6

It is designed to give about the same ballistics as Cordite M.D. A
further letter is sometimes added to show the form of the powder.
Thus Cordite M.D.T. is M.D. pressed into tubes; S. stands for strip.
The size is indicated by a numeral, which shows the diameter in
hundredths of an inch of the die through which it has been pressed.
In the case of tubular powder both the external and internal
diameters are given approximately: _e. g._ Cordite M.D.T. 5-2.

  Sodium chloride    7·2

=COTTON POWDER.= See =TONITE=, also =CP=.

=CP_1= and =CP_2= are varieties of nitrocotton (Coton Poudre) made
in France, principally for the manufacture of Poudre B and other
smokeless powders. CP_1 is a guncotton containing about 13 per
cent. of nitrogen, and only about 10 per cent. of matter soluble in
ether-alcohol. CP_2 is almost completely soluble in ether-alcohol,
and contains about 12 per cent. of nitrogen.

=CRÉSYLITE.=--A French high explosive used for filling shell and
other military purposes. Crésylite 60/40 consists of picric acid and
nitrated cresol in about the proportions of 40 of the former to 60
of the latter. It melts below the temperature of boiling water. The
nitrated cresol consists largely of trinitro-metacresol.

Crésylite No. 2 is simply crude trinitro-meta-cresol.

=CRONITE= is an American coal-mine explosive. There are two
varieties on the Permissible List, Nos. 1 and 5, both of which are
ammonium nitrate explosives.

=DYNAMITE= is a name that has been given to various
nitroglycerine explosives. Dynamite No. 1 consists of--

  Nitroglycerine   75
  Kieselguhr       25

the explosive being held in the pores of the kieselguhr. In other
dynamites the nitroglycerine is absorbed in a material like wood
meal, and a nitrate is added to oxidise the latter on explosion.

In Gelatine Dynamite the nitroglycerine is gelatinised with collodion
cotton. See under Gelatine.

American Dynamites are not generally gelatinised with collodion
cotton. They are made in a number of grades, depending on the
percentage of nitroglycerine.

For further details about various dynamites, see textbooks on
explosives.

It will be seen that all three are about equal as regards power, but
that No. 3, which contains the largest proportion of cooling agents
and more nitroglycerine, can be used safely in much greater charges.
In 1916 807,000 lbs. of No. 3 were used in mines and quarries,
principally in coal mines. It is recommended by the makers, Curtis’s
and Harvey, for hard coal and colliery work generally. The permits of
the others have been repealed.

=FAVIER= explosives consist essentially of ammonium nitrate
mixed with nitro-compounds. Favier took out patents in 1884 and
1885 for mixtures of ammonium nitrate with mononitro-naphthalene,
paraffin and resin. Their manufacture was undertaken soon afterwards
by the French Government, and is still continued under the names of
Explosifs N, or Explosifs Favier or Grisounites. Their composition
has been varied from time to time, but the following are those now

The Grisounites-couche are used in the coal seams as they have
theoretical temperatures of explosion of 1500° or less, but N_1 a
has been replaced to a considerable extent by N_4, because the
presence of a proportion of potassium nitrate is found to increase
the safety; these are both coloured green. The Grisounites-roche have
theoretical temperatures of explosion of 1900° or less, and are used
in the rocks in coal mines. N_1 b is dyed rose colour, and N_1 c
pale yellow.

Many explosives of this type are in use in different countries. On
the old British Permitted List were Ammonite, Westfalite, Bellite
and Roburite amongst others. Those now on the List contain ammonium
or sodium chloride to enable them to pass the Rotherham Test, _e.g._
the later Ammonites, Bellite Nos. 2 and 4, Faversham Powder and Negro
Powder.

nitrate explosive.

=FUELLPULVER= (or =FP.=) is the name given by the
Germans to mixtures of trinitro-toluene and ammonium nitrate used
for filling shell. Fp. 60/40, for instance, is a mixture of 60
parts trinitro-toluene and 40 parts of ammonium nitrate, and is
consequently the same as Amatol 40/60. Fp. without figures stands for
trinitro-toluene.

sodium or potassium chloride, and may contain up to 4 per cent. of
nitroglycerine to increase its sensitiveness.

=GELATINÉ À L’AMMONIAQUE.=--A Belgian explosive, a mixture of
blasting gelatine and ammonium nitrate.

=GELATINE DYNAMITE= is a mixture of blasting gelatine, potassium
nitrate and a little wood meal. That made in Britain must contain
between 70 and 77 per cent. of nitroglycerine; it may contain up
to 2 per cent. of calcium or magnesium carbonate, or 1/2 per cent.
of mineral jelly as a stabiliser. The following may be taken as an
example of its composition--

  Nitroglycerine      74·5
  Collodion cotton     5·5
  Wood meal            4

There are also a number of modified Gelignites, which either contain
sodium or barium nitrate in partial or entire replacement of the
potassium nitrate, or else contain some substance to reduce the
freezing point of the nitroglycerine and so diminish the danger of
freezing, such as dinitro- or trinitro-toluene or dinitro-glycol.

=GESILIT.=--A German coal-mine explosive made by Nahnsen. It
contains blasting gelatine, inorganic nitrates, sodium chloride,

be safer than the other two.

=GIANT COAL-MINE POWDERS= are American coal-mine explosives on
the Permissible List. No. 5 is an ammonium nitrate explosive, whereas
Nos. 6, 7 and 8 are low-grade dynamites mixed with hydrated salts.

=GIANT POWDER= is a name given in America to dynamite. No.
1 is a kieselguhr dynamite containing about 75 per cent. of
nitroglycerine. Many varieties, however, do not contain kieselguhr,
but consist of nitroglycerine mixed with wood pulp, sodium or
potassium nitrate, resin, sulphur or other combustible matter. The
nitroglycerine is sometimes gelatinised with collodion cotton, or in
the “Extra” varieties is partially replaced by ammonium nitrate.

=GLONOINE= was an early name for nitroglycerine.

=GLUECKAUF.=--A German explosive of the Grisounite type
consisting of ammonium nitrate and vegetable meal, to which might
be added any of the following: sugar, resin, fatty oil, potassium
nitrate, sodium nitrate, dinitro-benzene, ammonium oxalate, copper
oxalate, copper nitrate ammonia, or sodium chloride. It was used for
a time by several potash mines; was given up again by most of them.

=GOOD LUCK= was an explosive made by the Sprengstoffwerke
Glueckauf A.-G., and was on the old British Permitted List for
coal-mine explosives. It had the composition--

  Ammonium nitrate    82·5
  Dinitro-benzene      1
  Turmeric            10·5
  Copper oxalate       6

=GRANATFUELLUNG= (_i. e._ Shell-filling) is a name given by
the Germans to certain high explosives used for filling shell.
Granatfuellung C/88 is picric acid, and C/02 is trinitro-toluene.
See Fuellpulver. Other substances used in German shell and bombs
are trinitro-anisole, dinitro-benzene, hexanitro-diphenylamine and
hexanitro-diphenyl sulphide, otherwise picryl sulphide.

=GRISOUNITE.=--A French coal-mine explosive. See =FAVIER=
Explosives.

=GRISOUTINE= or =GRISOU-DYNAMINE= is the only explosive
except Grisounite allowed in the more dangerous French coal mines.
It consists of ammonium nitrate mixed with blasting gelatine.
As the State monopoly does not extend to explosives containing
nitroglycerine, it is made by private firms, but the compositions are
regulated by the “Commission des Substances Explosives,” which in
1911 resolved that they should be uniformly as follows--

                              Couche au             Roche au
                    Couche.    Salpêtre.   Roche.   Salpêtre.

  Nitroglycerine       12        12         29        29
  Collodion cotton      0·5       0·5        1         1
  Ammonium nitrate     87·5      82·5       70        65
  Potassium nitrate    --         5         --         5

The calculated temperatures of explosion of the Grisoutines couches
are below 1500°, and those of the Grisoutines roches below 1900°. The
addition of 5 per cent. of potassium nitrate is found to increase the
safety.

There are a number of explosives of this type made in other
countries also, but they usually contain small proportions of
combustible substances such as wood meal, and nitro-bodies such as
trinitro-toluene. Of British explosives of this type, mention may be
made of Monobel, Super-Excellite and Monarkite. German explosives
of this sort include Salit, Tremonit, Donarit, Ammon-Karbonit and
Astralit.

On the Belgian list of Explosifs S.G.P. is Grisoutine II., which is
identical in composition with Dynamite anti-grisouteuse V.

are ammonium nitrate explosives, whereas Guardian A and Guardian Coal
Powder B are nitroglycerine explosives.

=GUNCOTTON.=--A highly nitrated cotton containing about 13 per
cent. of nitrogen and only slightly soluble in ether-alcohol.

=GUNPOWDER.= See =BLACK POWDER=.


=*HALAKITE= attracted public attention out of all proportion
to its merits, of which it possessed none, in consequence of the
extravagant claims made on its behalf by its “inventors” and their
dupes. Early in 1917 the British Government caused an inquiry to be
held, and the case for the explosive collapsed in a ludicrous manner.
According to patent specification, No. 685 of 1915, the basis of
the explosive was an admixture of lead nitrate with glycerine and
other substances, and under the working conditions the glycerine was
said to react with the nitrate to form a nitro-compound, which, of
course, is not true. The substance actually submitted to the British
and French authorities consisted of cordite mixed with lead nitrate,
barium nitrate and lead chromate. This was stated by the promoters
to be equally effective as a high explosive and a propellant! See
“Interim and Final Reports of the Army Council (Halakite) Inquiry,”
Cd. 8446.

=HALALIT.=--A German blasting explosive made by Nahnsen,
containing not more than 65 per cent. of potassium perchlorate,
ammonium nitrate, and not more than 32 per cent. of nitrated toluene,
of which not more than 20 per cent. must be trinitro-toluene. It may
also contain collodion cotton to gelatinise the liquid nitro-toluene,
and sodium nitrate and wood meal or other vegetable meal.

Ammon-Halalit A, which has been introduced recently, is similar to
Astralit V.

=HALOKLASTIT.= See =PETROKLASTIT=.

than 40 per cent. of potassium or sodium perchlorate, not more than 4
per cent. of nitroglycerine, aromatic nitro-bodies, ammonium nitrate,
sodium or potassium nitrate, neutral salts and vegetable meal or
other combustible matter.

=HASSIA-CHLORAT= is an explosive that was introduced in Germany
during the War. It consists of 65 per cent. potassium chlorate and 35
per cent. combustible, and it is claimed that the large proportion of
the latter not only makes it a mild explosive, but also renders it
comparatively insensitive. It is also called Spreng-chlorat.

=HAYLITE.=--A coal-mine explosive made by the National
Explosives Co. There were three varieties on the Permitted List: No. 1
was also on the old Permitted List, but has now been repealed.

=H.E.= stands for High Explosive, used for charging shell or
other military purpose.

=*HEBLER POWDER= was a so-called smokeless powder which was
manufactured at one time in Switzerland. According to an analysis
published by Cundill and Thomson, it was ordinary gunpowder in which
about a fifth of the saltpetre had been replaced by ammonium nitrate.
It did not appear to have a greater tendency to absorb moisture than
ordinary powder. It was also called Wellite. See also Ammonpulver.

=HECLA NO. 2= is an American coal-mine explosive on the
Permissible List. It is an ammonium nitrate explosive made by the Du
Pont Co.

Köln-Rottweil Pulverfabriken. It contains not more than 10 per cent.
of potassium perchlorate, not more than 5 per cent. of zinc-aluminium
alloy, aromatic nitro-bodies and neutral nitrates, excepting those of
potassium and barium. It may also contain flour or potato meal and
neutral substances.

=HELIT= is a similar explosive to Helagon, except that it
contains dinitro-chlorhydrin, not more than 6 per cent., in the place
of the zinc-aluminium alloy.

=HELLHOFITE=}

  Dinitro-benzene    1       Nitro-benzene     1
  Nitric acid        1·5     Nitric acid       2·5

A form of this explosive was tried by Gruson as a charge
for shell many years ago. See also Panclastite.

substances, which was used for blasting. There was a coal-mine
explosive of this name on the Permitted List, made by the British
Explosives Syndicate, Ltd.--

  Power (swing of
     ballistic pendulum)    2·72”

but the permit has been repealed.

=HIMALAYITE.=--A high explosive made from potassium chlorate,
potato starch and a drying oil. The chlorate and starch are first
heated together with water, and when dry the oil is mixed in. The
explosive is said to have been adopted by the Portuguese for filling
shell. It passed the chemical tests in England, but no licence was
taken out for its manufacture.

=HUDSON’S EXPLOSIVE.=--A stiff blasting gelatine made by
incorporating nitroglycerine and collodion cotton together with the
aid of acetone. It was tried in America in 1889 for filling shell,
but is not used now for this purpose.

=HYGRADE COAL POWDER NO. 2= is an American coal-mine explosive
on the Permissible List. It is a nitroglycerine explosive.

=*IDEAL POWDER= is a shot-gun powder made by Nobels.

=IMPERIALITE= is of no practical importance, but is interesting, as
its history is that of the explosive one meets in the comic papers.
The Marquis R. Imperiali had large private means and some knowledge
of chemistry. He took out patents for a number of explosive mixtures
and built a small factory in N. Italy, which started work in 1911.
An explosion occurred the first day and killed five of the fifteen
workers. Imperiali escaped and re-erected his factory. The day after
it was restarted it blew up again and Imperiali was killed. The
composition of the explosive that was being made is not known, but
several of the mixtures for which Imperiali had taken out patents were
decidedly dangerous.

=*INDURITE= was a smokeless powder patented by C. E. Munroe in
1893. It was made by incorporating guncotton with nitro-benzene to
a hard mass. It was used for a time in the American Navy. Samples
made in 1891 were still stable apparently in 1914, but some cases of
instability occurred and it was given up.

=INGÉLITE= is the same in composition as =ANTIGEL DE
SÛRETÉ=.

*Poudre =J.=--A French smokeless powder used for
shot-guns and revolvers. Its composition is--

  Nitrocotton                 83
  Ammonium bichromate         14
  Potassium bichromate         3
  Moisture               about 3

It is incorporated with the aid of ether-alcohol and pressed into
strips, which are cut into cubes and then converted into grains of
irregular shape. The fine siftings are used for revolver and practice
ammunition.


=JUDSON POWDER.=--A mild blasting explosive used in America. It
is a sort of crude gunpowder coated with nitroglycerine to increase
the violence of the explosion. The percentage of nitroglycerine may
vary from 5 to 20, but is generally near the lower limit. Judson
Powder R.R.P. has the composition--

  Nitroglycerine    5      Nitroglycerine           5
  Sodium nitrate   64  or  Sulphur, coal and resin 35
  Sulphur          16      Sodium nitrate          60
  Cannel coal      15

The sodium nitrate is mixed with the combustibles and the mixture is
heated beyond the melting-point of the sulphur and resin. The
slightly porous mass thus formed is then coated with nitroglycerine.
The explosive is fired with a priming cartridge of dynamite. The
following four grades are made by the Du Pont Co.--

  FFF    20 % nitroglycerine
  FF     15        ”

Lignosit III. differs from I. in that it may contain up to 4 per
cent. of blasting gelatine and contains no bauxite.

The object of adding the neutral salts is evidently to make the
explosive safer in coal mines. When intended for this purpose it is
called Wetter-Lignosit I. or III.

Lignosit IV. consists of ammonium nitrate, not more than 13 per cent.
of trinitro-toluene, not more than 13 per cent. of aluminium powder,
and wood meal.

  Barium nitrate    20
  Potassium nitrate  5
  Camphor.           3
  Binding material   1

The nitrocotton has a solubility of only 15 or 20 per cent., and is
partially gelatinised with ether-alcohol aided by the camphor. It is
granulated under edge runners, granulated and drummed.


=MACARIT.=--A Belgian high explosive for filling shell--

  Trinitro-toluene    30
  Lead nitrate        70

or ammonium perchlorate, generally the potassium salt. It is
manufactured at Bonnybridge, Stirling, at the works originally
erected for making Mitchellite. During manufacture the composition is
heated in steam boilers. (See “Arms and Explosives,” 1911, p. 7.)

=M.D.= See =CORDITE=.

=MEGANIT= is a Hungarian nitroglycerine explosive similar to
American dynamite, except that it contains a small percentage of
nitrated vegetable ivory.

=MELANITE.=--A Belgian blasting explosive consisting of--

  Nitroglycerine    78
  Collodion cotton   4
  Sodium nitrate    18

It contains, therefore, a considerable excess of oxygen.

=MÉLINITE= is a high explosive used by the French for filling
shell and other military purposes. It consists essentially of picric
acid, to which other substances are sometimes added. Paraffin wax has
been added to diminish the sensitiveness. Mélinite D is simply picric
acid, but Mélinite O contains also a little Crésilite 2 (q. v.).

is a German chlorate explosive of the Sprengel class. It consists
of porous potassium chlorate impregnated with not more than 10 per
cent. of kerosene, having a flash point not below 30° C. It has met
with some unfavourable reports, as it is found that results are not
uniform unless the impregnation be carried out in special factories,
the original idea having been that it was to be done shortly before
use.

During the War a modification of the explosive was introduced for use
in coal mines. This contains up to 30 per cent. of sodium chloride.

There was also a variety containing lead nitrate, but this could not
be used in mines because of the poisonous smoke it evolved.

=*MISCHPULVER= is a name given in German to ungelatinised
smokeless nitro-cellulose powders.

=MITCHELLITE= was an explosive that was formerly licensed for
manufacture in Great Britain, and was made at Bonnybridge, Stirling,

  Volatile matter    0·2

Of the nitrocellulose about one-third was soluble in ether-alcohol.
It was made in the form of strip.

=MONACHIT= is a German blasting explosive which was known at one
time as Vigorit. It is distinguished by containing nitro-compounds
derived from naphtha, mostly nitro-xylenes and nitro-mesitylenes.

=OXYLIQUIT= is a blasting explosive consisting of liquid oxygen
absorbed in some porous combustile material, such as absorbent cork,
soot or kieselguhr mixed with petroleum. It was discovered in 1895
by Prof. F. C. Linde, and was tried on a large scale in 1899 in the
construction of the Simplon tunnel. It is very cheap, and is safe in
the case of a missfire, because in about half-an-hour the oxygen has
all evaporated off and the charge becomes inexplosive. On the other
hand, it is necessary to have the air liquefying plant near the scene
of operations, and the charge must be fired soon after charging.
These disadvantages prevented the adoption of the explosive, but
during the War fresh trials were made in Germany in consequence of
the scarcity of nitrates.

Liquid oxygen explosives are now used on a considerable scale by
the Germans for military, as well as civil blasting operations. The
name Oxyliquit, however, seems only to be applied to them when the
explosive is made in the manner and with the plant of the Linde
Company. See also Marsit.

=PANCLASTITE.=--A Sprengel explosive made by mixing liquid
nitrogen peroxide with carbon bisulphide, nitro-benzene or
nitro-toluene. It was proposed in 1881 by Turpin, and was tried by
Germany for filling shell, the two constituents being contained
in separate glass containers, which were broken by the shock of
discharge. It was not adopted there on account of the inconvenience
of dealing with a liquid which gives off poisonous fumes. It is a
powerful and violent explosive, and is probably the same as the
“Turpinite” about which sensational statements were made in the press
early in the War.

=PANNONIT.=--A blasting explosive made by the A. G. Dynamit
Nobel of Austria. It has replaced Progressit in Austria as a
coal-mine explosive. Its composition is--

to the monoxide. It was first prepared by Mendeléeff for the Russian
smokeless powder, and was afterwards adopted by the United States for
their present powder.

=PYROXILINE= was a name formerly given to nitro-cellulose.

=RACK-A-ROCK= is a Sprengel explosive which has been used
extensively in America, and also in Siberia and China. It consists
of cartridges of potassium chlorate mixed sometimes with oxide of
iron, which are dipped shortly before use into a liquid. The latter
is nitro-benzene or “dead oil,” a heavy hydrocarbon oil obtained
from coal-tar, or a mixture of the two. The chlorate cartridges
are enclosed in small cotton bags, and are placed in a wire basket
suspended from a spring balance. They are dipped into a vessel
containing the liquid until a quarter or a third of the weight of the
chlorate has been taken up.

=RASCHIT= is a blasting explosive consisting entirely of salts
readily soluble in water, invented by F. Raschig. The incorporation

=SAXONITE= was the predecessor of Samsonite on the old Permitted
List. It has practically the same composition, but wide limits
are allowed. It also is used for general purposes. During the War
potassium nitrate was replaced by sodium nitrate.

Ammon-=SCHLESIT= or Kohlen-=SCHLESIT= is a German
coal-mine explosive containing ammonium nitrate and other nitrates,
nitro-compounds, starch, neutral salts, not more than 4 per cent.
of blasting gelatine, and not more than 2 per cent. of potassium
perchlorate.

=SCHNEIDERITE= is a high explosive used by the French for
filling shell. Its composition is the same as the Favier explosive
N_1 c.

=*SCHULTZE POWDER= was the first successful smokeless powder
made. It was invented by Capt. E. Schultze of the Prussian Artillery,
who appears at first simply to have impregnated little grains of
wood with saltpetre (Eng. Pat. 900 of 1864). But later the wood
cellulose was purified and nitrated, and then mixed with nitrates.
The powder has remained the same as this until the present day,
although the methods of manufacture have been developed and, indeed,
revolutionised more than once. In “Arms and Explosives,” 1917, p. 75,
the following analyses of different brands were given--

=SEBOMITE= is a French chlorate explosive resembling Cheddite,
but containing tallow instead of castor oil.

=SECURITE= was one of the first coal-mine explosives. It
contained ammonium nitrate and dinitro-benzene, and was therefore
similar to Bellite and Roburite.

=SECUROPHORE.=--A Belgian coal-mine explosive containing
nitroglycerine, nitrates, flour and other constituents.

=SENGITE= is a variety of Tonite introduced in South Africa
as a substitute for Gelignite in consequence of the scarcity of
glycerine due to the War. It contains guncotton and sodium nitrate,
and sufficient moisture to render it safe to handle without
diminishing its strength. The first four letters of its name stand
for _s_ubstitute _e_xplosive _n_o _g_lycerine. It requires a priming
cartridge of gelignite or similar explosive. It is more expensive
than gelignite, and consequently is not likely to be used when the
scarcity of glycerine has been relieved.

=SHELLITE.=--A high explosive consisting of picric acid and
dinitro-phenol, used for filling shells. The mixture possesses
the advantage over straight picric acid that it melts at a lower
temperature. It was for a time called Picrol.

=SHEPPEY POWDER.=--A coal-mine explosive made by the Cotton
Powder Co. which was on the Permitted List for a short time, but was
removed in 1914--

  _Date of Permit_                  25-11-13

=SIEGENIT.=--A German blasting explosive containing ammonium
nitrate, flour, and not more than 15 per cent. of dinitro-toluene.
For use in coal mines, sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate are
added as diluents, and nitroglycerine to increase the sensitiveness.

=SILESIA= is a German blasting explosive consisting of potassium
chlorate, the particles of which are coated with resin or oxidised
resin. The latter is made by treating ground colophony, mixed with 10
per cent. of starch, with nitric acid. After washing and drying this
is incorporated with the chlorate with the aid of alcohol, in which
it is soluble. For use in coal mines sodium chloride is sometimes
added. The following are examples--

                        4.   4_a_.  IV. 22.
  Potassium chlorate    80    80      70

It is practically the same as Steelite.

=*S.K., S.R., S.S., S.V.= were partially gelatinised fibrous
smokeless powders, introduced by the Smokeless Powder Co. about 1889.
They are no longer made. The following analyses were given in “Arms
and Explosives,” 1917, p. 77--

                                  S.R.   S.S.

The nitrocellulose was made from lignin. S.S. was a 38-grain bulk
powder; S.R. was a fibrous powder for rifles; S.K. a similar powder
for small rifles, and S.V. for revolvers.

=*SMOKELESS DIAMOND= is a 33-grain bulk smokeless powder for
shot-guns, introduced in 1903 by Curtis’s and Harvey. According to an
analysis in “Arms and Explosives,” 1917, p. 78, its composition is--

  Nitrocellulose, insoluble    69·0
         ”        soluble       6·6
  Metallic nitrates            15·0

=*SOLENITE.=--A smokeless powder introduced in Italy in 1896 for
use in rifles--

  Nitroglycerine               34
  Nitrocotton, soluble         63
  Mineral jelly                 3

It is gelatinised with the aid of acetone, and is made in the form of
translucent short tubes of a light brown colour.

=SPRENGCHLORAT.= See Hassia-Chlorat.

=SPRENGEL EXPLOSIVES= were patented in 1871 by Dr. Hermann
Sprengel, F.R.S., the inventor of the mercury vacuum pump. They are
made by mixing an oxidising substance with a combustible one, the
essential features being that one or both of the substances must be
liquid, and the mixing takes place shortly before the explosive is
required. The mixture is exploded by means of a fulminate detonator.
As oxidising agents, Sprengel mentioned amongst others nitric acid
and potassium chlorate; nitrogen peroxide has also been used; as
combustibles, a large number of substances including nitro-benzene,
nitro-naphthalene, carbon bisulphide, petroleum and picric acid. For
most purposes nitric acid is an inconvenient material to use. Porous
cartridges of potassium chlorate constitute the oxidiser generally
employed, the combustibles being hydrocarbon oils and nitro-benzene.
This possesses considerable advantages, as there is no danger of
a premature explosion until the constituents have been mixed.
Under the British Explosives Act, however, this mixing constitutes
“manufacture,” and can only be carried out in a properly licensed
factory. Consequently Sprengel explosives have not been used in Great
Britain, but they have been employed on a considerable scale in the
United States, France, Italy and other countries.

For examples of Sprengel explosives _see_ Panclastite, Prométhée,
Rack-a-Rock.

=SPRENGGELATINE= is the German for Blasting Gelatine.

=SPRENGSALPETER= is a cheap German blasting powder made from
sodium nitrate, sulphur and brown coal. It is used in the potash
mines.

=STABILITE= is a name that has been given to trinitro-anisole.
It has been tried as a constituent of a smokeless powder, but it
belies its title as it is readily hydrolysed with the formation of
picric acid. It has also been used by the Germans as a filling for
bombs.

=STANFORD POWDER.=--A coal-mine explosive of the Favier class
which was on the Permitted List for a short time in 1913.

*Poudre =T= is a condensed smokeless shot-gun powder
manufactured by the French Government. It is made from guncotton,
CP_1, to which 2 per cent. of saltpetre is added, gelatinised with
acetone. The dough is pressed into strips which are rolled down to a
thickness of 0·15 mm. and cut into small squares of 1·5 mm. side. The
powder is then steeped in water to dissolve out the greater part of
the potassium nitrate, dried, and finally drummed with a little gum
and graphite to make it more progressive. This powder is superior to
the other French sporting-powders, but is more expensive. The charge
for a 16-bore cartridge is 1·9 grammes.


=TELSIT A= is a blasting explosive made at the Nobel Works in
Switzerland. It consists of ammonium nitrate, nitrated toluene and
aluminium powder.

Gelatine-Telsit contains ammonium nitrate, blasting gelatine and
liquid trinitro-toluene, also gelatinised with collodion cotton.

Special-Gelatine-Telsit differs from this in having part of the
ammonium nitrate replaced by sodium nitrate.

=TERRIT= is a plastic blasting explosive made in Sweden, and
consisting of ammonium perchlorate, sodium nitrate and liquid
dinitro-toluene, gelatinised with collodion cotton--

  Ammonium perchlorate         43
  Sodium nitrate               28
  Dinitro-toluene (liquid)     27·8

It is used extensively as an intermediate detonating agent for
high-explosive shell, as it is somewhat more sensitive than most of
the explosives used, and can consequently be detonated by a small
charge of fulminate. It is also called C. E.

oxides and other metals are sometimes used. When initiated by strong
heat in one place a reaction sets in with great evolution of heat
and the formation of a white-hot mass of molten iron and slag. It
differs from an explosive in that no gas is formed and the reaction
is comparatively slow. It is used for filling incendiary bombs and
for many industrial purposes.

=THORNIT.=--A German blasting explosive consisting of ammonium
nitrate and vegetable meal. It may also contain animal or vegetable

  Nitro-toluenes       70
  Collodion cotton      1·2
  Lead nitrate         28·8

It was intended for filling shell, etc.

*=TROISDORF SMOKELESS POWDER= became prominent in England
in 1897 in connection with Mannlicher cartridges for the Bisley
long-range competitions. It was occasionally recorded as Pigou Wilkes
Powder, as that firm were agents for it. The following are analyses
of samples taken in 1898 (“Arms and Explosives,” 1917, p. 90)--

                               Shot-gun    Rifle
                               Powder.     Powder.

=VIGORITE= is a name that has been given to several explosives
in the past. One of these, manufactured in California in the
’seventies of the last century, contained potassium chlorate and
nitroglycerine, and consequently was decidedly dangerous. It gave
rise to a serious accident on the Grand Trunk Railway.

The Atlas Powder Co. in America manufacture a series of coal-mine
explosives under this name. They are nitroglycerine explosives.

=VIKING POWDER= is a coal-mine explosive made by Nobel’s

=*WALSRODE SHOT-GUN POWDER= was a gelatinised 28-grain dense
powder, which the German makers endeavoured to introduce into England
in the ’nineties, but it gave high pressures. A powder of this name
is still used in Germany, however, but it is a 35-grain powder in the
form of small grains, greyish white and greyish green in colour.

=WALSRODE SICHERHEITS-SPRENGSTOFF= is a German coal-mine
explosive containing ammonium nitrate, trinitro-toluene, flour, and a

no guncotton but may contain potassium nitrate, sodium chloride,
naphthalene, and various other substances.

=WESTFALITE= is a coal-mine explosive which is made in Germany
and England. The German explosives vary much in composition, and some
of them are intended for ordinary blasting. Some of those recently
introduced contain up to 10 per cent. of potassium perchlorate.
Originally Westfalite was made by milling ammonium nitrate with an
alcoholic solution of gum lac, but later the use of the gum was
abandoned.

British Westfalite, Ltd., had two mixtures on the old Permitted List--

                                    No. 1.   No. 2.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
